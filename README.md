Parallel numerical integration using MPI, OpenMP and pthreads
# Parallel Numerical Integration using Simpson’s Rule

Course project for the discipline  
**Parallel Programming on Supercomputer Systems**

## Project Description
In this project, numerical integration using the composite Simpson’s rule
is implemented and executed using several parallel programming approaches:

- C + MPI
- Python + MPI (mpi4py)
- C + POSIX Threads (pthreads)
- C + OpenMP

The goal of the project is to compare correctness and performance of
different parallel programming models on a supercomputer.

## Execution Environment
All experiments were performed on the **SPbSTU supercomputer**
using the **tornado partition**.

## Project Structure
- `src/` — source code files
- `report/` — final project report (PDF)
- `scripts/` — execution and analysis scripts
- `data/` — input data and result files
